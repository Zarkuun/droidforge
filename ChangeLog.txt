    See releases notes of Droid blue-4 firmware

	New features since last beta:
	* Fix: [encoder] and [encoderbank]: Fix bogus LED/Button mismatch warning
	  (found by @oedoen)
	* Fix: Doing "Add remaining parameters" to a circuit that is *disabled*
	  would add the parameters enabled. When saving the patch, these parameters
	  would then be without the needed comment character and thus be part
	  of the *previous* circuit! This has been fixed. The added parameters
	  now automatically get disabled when the circuit is disabled (found
	  by @oedoen).

1.1:
	New features:
	* The Forge now handles multiple patch windows in parallel. With the
	  actions "New window", "New window with same rack" and "Open in new window"
	  you can create a new patch window. This allows for easy copy & paste
	  between your different patches and also makes a multi-master-setup
	  easier to handle.
	* There is now a search function, finally! Command-F (or the menu entry)
	  starts it. You can search for all that makes up a patch, including
	  circuit names, circuit comments, parameters, cables, registers and numbers.
	* New function for doing a search & replace in all cable names (or all
	  in the current selection if there is one). You can for example copy
	  a complete section, do "select all" there, and then rename e.g. "VOICE1"
	  to "VOICE2" in all cables.
	* You can now set a bookmark at your current cursor position in the patch
	  with Command+Shift+J. Later you can jump back to that position by pressing
	  Cmd+J (J stands for "jump"). You can have just one bookmark, setting
	  a new one will remove the previous one. This feature is intended to help
	  you in a situation where you need to find a different position in
	  your patch for copying or viewing something and than coming back to where
	  you were.
	* New "Text mode" view option. In this mode all decorations, icons, lines,
	  etc are omitted from the patch view, the font is monospaced and everything
	  looks much like a raw Droid patch. The whole way you edit the patch is
	  still the same as in normal mode.
	* When the cursor is on a register like input, output, button, pot or LED,
	  you can now directly set a label for that register with Command+L or
	  with the Edit/Popup menu. The shortcut for "Fix button/LED mismatches"
	  has changed to Shift+Command+L.
	* New view option "Show master on the right side". This will display all
	  modules in reversed order, for those of you that have mounted the controllers
	  from right to left.
	* You can now save a patch section as a patch into a new file (using the Section
	  menu or popup menu on the section)
	* New "Preferences" dialog with two now options for patch compression. Renaming
	  cables to short things like _A, _B when deploying reduces the patch size
	  (There is a maximum patch size of 64k).
	* New option to ignore unknown jacks (in preferences). This allows you to try
	  new firmware features (new inputs and outputs) without updating the Forge.
	* New action for copying a controller with or without its labels
	* In list of patch cables in value editor the entered name is now a search
	  filter for the list of cables. That makes it much faster to find an
	  existing cable.
	* New action for loading a status dump from your SD card. Such a dump
	  is created with a double click on the master's button. It contains the
	  current values of all registers and internal cables. The Forge can now
	  load such a file and display the values in the patch. If you are working
	  with the X7, put the lever to the left for getting access to the SD
	  card and the status file on it without removing the SD card manually.
	* Sections can now have comments. The section comment is displayed at the
	  top if it is not empty. Edit it with Alt-C or the menu entry or by double
	  clicking on it (if it is already there).

	Clean ups:
	* Expand parameter array now increases the button/LED number and also input or
	  output number of the first argument, if possible. This does not always make sense
	  but is often a great speed up, e.g. if you create an algoquencer with 16 buttons
	  of a B32. Simply create the first line and select "expand parameter array to max"
	  and you are done.
	* Display RAM usage of current section in tooltip of status bar's memory indicator.
	* New action "Duplicate section smartly", which does what "Duplicate section"
	  did do. And "Duplicate section" now makes a plain dumb copy with no renamings
	  or remappings.
	* Shortcut Command+M for minimizing a Forge window (Mac standard) (manual is now
	  Command+T)
	* Make white label areas wider, so that more text fits in (suggested by
	  @Second_Breakfast)
	* Rename "recent files" to "recent patches"
	* Replaced app icon by a version contributed by @Harrison (thanks for your nice icon,
	  Harrison!)
	* The settings "show register labels" and "show register usage" are now
	  saved and not reset every time you start the Forge.
	* Speed up cursor movement by delaying update of highliting of used registers
	  by 100 ms.
	* Allow zooming in in rack view beyond the visibility of all modules (and enable
	  horizontal scroll bar if needed).
	* The shortcut for "circuit manual" and "user manual" have been changed to
	  Command+T and Command+shift+T, since Command+M now minimizes the Window
	  "Mac standard"
	* The "End" key now really goes to the end of the current section, i.e. to
	  the last line of the last circuit, not to its header.
	* New buttons "No to all" and "Yes to all" in dialog for automatically renaming
	  cables when duplicating a section (or similar operations)
	* The statusbar now also checks the size of the patch. There is a maximum of
	  64,000 bytes. The status bar now either shows the RAM usage or the size
	  usage - depending on which of both is bigger. Loading of too big patches
	  via SD card or X7 is inhibited now.
	* Prevent nonallowed characters to be used in names of cables.
	* Allow cable names to start with a digit (like _1). Such cable names are not
	  proposed but legal.
	* Cable selector: you can now move the cursor from the entry field to the first
	  element in the list with the Down key.
	* Always save the patch before depolying it to the SD card.
	* There is a maximum of 63 characters for line in a patch. The master will complain
	  about longer lines. This is now checked by the Forge.
	* Fix setting focus correctly in value selector when pressing buttons.
	* Add "Manual" button to "Edit parameter" dialog, for getting direct access
	  to the circuit's manual.
	* Visualize used M4 faders and buttons as rectangles, not as circles.
	* Show the scroll bar in the section list if it is too long.
	* Hide menu entries for finishing/aborting cabling when they are not
	  useful.

	Bug fixes:
	* FIX: Make computation of used RAM precise
	* FIX: Add correct manual of Droid firmware blue-2. This also fixes the issue
	  with the wrong page numbers.
	* FIX: Fix crash when deleting contents of a cell of an undefined parameter
	  (found by @Michael Gerdau)
	* FIX: Fix crash when hitting enter on a circuit comment
	* FIX: When opening the popup menu on a section, select that section so
	  the menu action is performed on the clicked section

	* FIX: The section cursor is now correctly white (instead of black) after starting
	  or loading a new patch
	* FIX: Fix crash when resizing the rack view a lot in a short time
	* FIX: Make sure cursor position is always visible in parameter selection
	  window.
	* FIX: Avoid crash when trying to load a patch that is bigger than the allowed
	  maximum size of 64,000 bytes.
	* FIX: When your first section had no title and you moved it to a different
	  position, it got merged with the section before. This has been fixed.
	* FIX: When jumping to a folded circuit by following a cable or register,
	  it was correctly unfolded by no graphics update was done so everything was garbled.
	  This has been fixed.
	* FIX: Save the rack size when it was changed with the menu entries or
	  keyboard shortcuts (previously it was just saved when you moved
	  the bar between the rack and the patch with the mouse).
	* Fix glitch where the wrong cable is shown and the list of cables just
	  has one row when editing a cable by pressing enter or double clicking.
	* Fix potential crash in "fix button/LED mismatch". This *could* possibly
	  fix the crash that @eising has reported.
	* Fix actions "paste smartly" and "paste as section". They were never
	  enabled.
	* Remove unsave characters like ; : " \ and / from a section title before
	  suggesting a filename when saving a section as patch (found by @oedoen)
	* Fix visibility and initial size of user manual PDF viewer.
	* Fix missing or non-updated graphics of "dragging indicator" in section list,
	  which happened when you dragged sections in a longer list that was scrolled
	  up too far.

	  was a comment like "# BD = bass drum" in the global comment section (reported
	  and nailed down by @Brian (The Aefonic))
	* FIX: When double clicking on the background, the new circuit will now be placed
	  nearest to the click. That way you can easily decide where to insert a new
	  circuit. Before it was always on the top (reported by @odessa)
	* FIX: Fix missing icons for button/LED mismatch (bulb) and folded circuit
	* FIX: Fix cursor moving to unchartered territory when adding a jack while the
	  circuit is folded.
	* FIX: Fix titles of source code editor windows: make clear what's edited.
	* FIX: Fix window suddenly getting wider in certain situations.
	* FIX: Add new sections at the end when double clicking
	* FIX: Fix copy & paste of fractions like 1/120, which are allowed in the third
	       column
	* FIX: You now can enter fractions of the form 1/X into in input cell also
	       directly, without the dialog
	* FIX: Fixed memory leak that made the Forge more and more RAM.
	* FIX: Minor layout fixes in value selection dialog
	* FIX: Fix cursor hanging "in the air" when pasting a parameter line
	  into a folded circuit

	* FIX: Don't swap controllers when you drag a button/pot into an empty
	       space of another controller.

0.7:
    Bug fixes:
	* FIX: Mac: automatically detect dark/light mode switch of system preferences
	       and immediately switch colors in the Forge, as well (might also work
	       on Windows, but not tested yet).
	* FIX: Fix text in cell overlapping to next cell
	* FIX: Fix too large initial size of dialogs
	* FIX: Fix too large font size of internal cable statusbar information on
               Windows

	       a cable name (when creating or renaming cables)
	* FIX: Fix size of vertical separator bar and paddings
	* FIX: cable section list now makes use of available width

	       selector

	Features:
	* Support for magenta-12
