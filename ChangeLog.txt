0.6:
    Bug fixes:
	* FIX: Leaving a direct cell editing with cursor down would skip
		   two lines.
	* FIX: Fix values like 0.2000000234324 when adding a new circuit
	       with typical example (default values of input jacks)
	* FIX: Don't wrap text in control labels if it's too long
	* FIX: Fix misaligned problem marker if parameter has a comment
	* FIX: Fix parsing of "root = I1 / 120 + 18"

	Features:
	* Support for magenta-12
	* Cell editor: Make description of parameter selectable
	* Patch view: double click on parameter name edits parameter comment
	  (information) instead of a change of the parameter (that can still
	  be done with Enter)
	* Menu: New action "New with same rack...". This is like "New..." but
	  keeps all controllers in place. The short cut of "New..." and the
	  toolbar icon now call this action.

0.5:
    Bug fixes:
	* FIX: Fixed crash when deleting the problem before the last problem (found
	       by @nohumans)
	* FIX: Fixed crash when cutting an empty cell (found by @Mario Paler)
	* FIX: Fix bug where a double click on a module (not on a jack/control)
	       opens a labelling dialog where the existing labels are missing
		   (found by @Mario Paler)
	* FIX: Fix number precision bug where 0.3 gets converted into 0.30000001773773
	* FIX: Fix two undo messages (bogus "%s" in message)
	* FIX: Fix detecting if SD card is present (enabling of SD card icon)
	* FIX: Memory computation now also takes controllers into account (just
	       a slight difference but that might be important)

	Features:
	* Fast copy: command + mouse click on a cell copies that cell's content
	  to the cursor position (previously it was vice versa)
	* Edit cell: After editing the contents of a cell (via direct typing
	  or via the cell editor) the cursor moves one row down (if there
	  is one more in the current circuit)
	* Parameter chooser: Add information about the type of CV a parameter
	  expects or outputs.
	* Mac DMG: Create background image for DMG installer (not final yet)
	* Labels: Move labels of controls above the controls (were below)
	* Plugs: Better colors for cable plugs
	* Icons: New colors for circuit icons
	* Colors: Small adaption to various colors and backgrounds

0.4:
    Bug fixes:
	* FIX: avoid numbers like 1.123e-5
	* FIX: don't convert numbers like 0.000000001 to 0 anymore
	* FIX: Manual viewer: do not open external viewer when pressing enter
	* FIX: Fix cursor jumping glitch when comment of a circuit is larger than
	       the patch screen (found by @Mario Paler)
    * FIX: Various parameters where missing when adding all remaining parameters
	       with "Add remaining parameters" (found by @Mario Paler)
	* FIX: Fix crash when doing shift cursor in empty section (found by @Mario Paler)
	* FIX: Fix empty labelling dialog when using popup menu on button / jack (found
	       by @Mario Paler)
    * FIX: Keypad now also works for direct number entry (found be @Mario Paler)
	* FIX: Updated user manual and fixed page numbers of circuits
	* FIX: Allow to close user manual with Escacpe key (as with all dialogs)
	* FIX: Make rendering of register marker circles and arrows smooth, avoid
	       pixels.
	* FIX: Fix too wide lines when dragging things on low resolution screens
	* FIX: Make controllers look smooth on low resolution screens

	Features:
	* Manual viewer: cursor left and right now also work for page switching
	* Status bar: new element for showing the memory consumption of your patch
	* Patch: create a "problem" on circuits that exceed the available DROID memory
	* Installer: Add link to "Applications" for an easy drag & drop installation
	* Toolbar: add hover information for the two activation icons (MIDI + SD) that
	  explains the reason why it is deactivated.
	* Toolbar: make problem icon colored, so you see it immediately
	* Rack view: use 1 HP blind plate as seperator, not gap
