1.1beta1:
	New features:
	* The Forge now handles multiple patch windows in parallel. With the
	  actions "New window", "New window with same rack" and "Open in new window"
	  you can create a new patch window. This allows for easy copy & paste
	  between your different patches and also makes a multi-master-setup
	  easier to handle.
	* There is now a search function, finally! Command-F (or the menu entry)
	  starts it. You can search for all that makes up a patch, including
	  circuit names, circuit comments, parameters, cables, registers and numbers.
	* New function for doing a search & replace in all cable names (or all
	  in the current selection if there is one). You can for example copy
	  a complete section, do "select all" there, and then rename e.g. "VOICE1"
	  to "VOICE2" in all cables.
	* You can now set a bookmark at your current cursor position in the patch
	  with Command+Shift+J. Later you can jump back to that position by pressing
	  Cmd+J (J stands for "jump"). You can have just one bookmark, setting
	  a new one will remove the previous one. This feature is intended to help
	  you in a situation where you need to find a different position in
	  your patch for copying or viewing something and than coming back to where
	  you were.
	* New "Text mode" view option. In this mode all decorations, icons, lines,
	  etc are omitted from the patch view, the font is monospaced and everything
	  looks much like a raw Droid patch. The whole way you edit the patch is
	  still the same as in normal mode.
	* When the cursor is on a register like input, output, button, pot or LED,
	  you can now directly set a label for that register with Command+L or
	  with the Edit/Popup menu. The shortcut for "Fix button/LED mismatches"
	  has changed to Shift+Command+L.
	* New view option "Show master on the right side". This will display all
	  modules in reversed order, for those of you that have mounted the controllers
	  from right to left.
	* You can now save a patch section as a patch into a new file (using the Section
	  menu or popup menu on the section)
	* New "Preferences" dialog with two now options for patch compression. Renaming
	  cables to short things like _A, _B when deploying reduces the patch size
	  (There is a maximum patch size of 64k).
	* New option to ignore uknown jacks (in preferences). This allows you to try
	  new firmware features (new inputs and outputs) without updating the Forge.
	* New action for copying a controller with or without its labels
	* In list of patch cables in value editor the entered name is now a search
	  filter for the list of cables. That makes it much faster to find an
	  existing cable.
	* New action for loading a status dump from your SD card. Such a dump
	  is created with a double click on the master's button. It contains the
	  current values of all registers and internal cables. The Forge can now
	  load such a file and display the values in the patch. If you are working
	  with the X7, put the lever to the left for getting access to the SD
	  card and the status file on it without removing the SD card manually.

	Clean ups:
	* Expand parameter array now increases the button/LED number and also input or
	  output number of the first argument, if possible. This does not always make sense
	  but is often a great speed up, e.g. if you create an algoquencer with 16 buttons
	  of a B32. Simply create the first line and select "expand parameter array to max"
	  and you are done.
	* Display RAM usage of current section in tooltip of status bar's memory indicator.
	* New action "Duplicate section smartly", which does what "Duplicate section"
	  did do. And "Duplicate section" now makes a plain dumb copy with no renamings
	  or remappings.
	* Shortcut Command+M for minimizing a Forge window (Mac standard) (manual is now
	  Command+T)
	* Make white label areas wider, so that more text fits in (suggested by
	  @Second_Breakfast)
	* Rename "recent files" to "recent patches"
	* Replaced app icon by a version contributed by @Harrison (thanks for your nice icon,
	  Harrison!)
	* The settings "show register labels" and "show register usage" are now
	  saved and not reset every time you start the Forge.
	* Speed up cursor movement by delaying update of highliting of used registers
	  by 100 ms.
	* Allow zooming in in rack view beyond the visibility of all modules (and enable
	  horizontal scroll bar if needed).
	* The shortcut for "circuit manual" and "user manual" have been changed to
	  Command+T and Command+shift+T, since Command+M now minimizes the Window
	  "Mac standard"
	* The "End" key now really goes to the end of the current section, i.e. to
	  the last line of the last circuit, not to its header.
	* New buttons "No to all" and "Yes to all" in dialog for automatically renaming
	  cables when duplicating a section (or similar operations)
	* The statusbar now also checks the size of the patch. There is a maximum of
	  64,000 bytes. The status bar now either shows the RAM usage or the size
	  usage - depending on which of both is bigger. Loading of too big patches
	  via SD card or X7 is inhibited now.
	* Prevent nonallowed characters to be used in names of cables.
	* Allow cable names to start with a digit (like _1). Such cable names are not
	  proposed but legal.
	* Cable selector: you can now move the cursor from the entry field to the first
	  element in the list with the Down key.

	Bug fixes:
	* FIX: Add correct manual of Droid firmware blue-2. This also fixes the issue
	  with the wrong page numbers.
	* FIX: Fix crash when deleting contents of a cell of an undefined parameter
	  (found by @Michael Gerdau)
	* FIX: Fix crash when hitting enter on a circuit comment
	* FIX: When opening the popup menu on a section, select that section so
	  the menu action is performed on the clicked section
	* FIX: Correctly load patches with a number like ".3" instead of "0.3".
	* FIX: Fix left over white register cursor when loading a new patch
	* FIX: The section cursor is now correctly white (instead of black) after starting
	  or loading a new patch
	* FIX: Fix crash when resizing the rack view a lot in a short time
	* FIX: Make sure cursor position is always visible in parameter selection
	  window.

	  and nailed down by @Brian (The Aefonic))
	* FIX: When double clicking on the background, the new circuit will now be placed
	  nearest to the click. That way you can easily decide where to insert a new
	  circuit. Before it was always on the top (reported by @odessa)

	* FIX: Fix cursor moving to unchartered territory when adding a jack while the
	  circuit is folded.

	       a cable name (when creating or renaming cables)
	* FIX: Fix size of vertical separator bar and paddings
	* FIX: cable section list now makes use of available width
	* FIX: Fix various bugs when the cursor is in the 2nd or 3rd

	       selector

	Features:
	* Support for magenta-12

	* Patch view: double click on parameter name edits parameter comment
	  (information) instead of a change of the parameter (that can still
	  be done with Enter)

	  is one more in the current circuit)
	* Parameter chooser: Add information about the type of CV a parameter
	  expects or outputs.
