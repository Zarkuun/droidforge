1.1beta1:
	New features:
	* New "Text mode" view option. In this mode all decorations, icons, lines,
	  etc are omitted from the patch view, the font is monospaced and everything
	  looks much like a raw Droid patch. The whole way you edit the patch is
	  still the same as in normal mode.
	* The settings "show register labels" and "show register usage" are now
	  saved and not reset every time you start the Forge.
	* When you cursor is on a register like input, output, button, pot or LED,
	  you can now directly set a label for that register with Command+L or
	  with the Edit/Popup menu.
	* New view option "Show master on the right side". This will display all
	  modules in reversed order, for those of you that have mounted the controllers
	  from right to left.
	* You can now save a patch section as a patch into a new file (using the Section
	  menu or popup menu on the section)

	Bug fixes:
	* FIX: Add correct manual of Droid firmware blue-2. This also fixes the issue
	  with the wrong page numbers.
	* FIX: Fix crash when deleting contents of a cell of an undefined parameter
	  (found by @Michael Gerdau)
	* FIX: Fix crash when hitting enter on a circuit comment
	* FIX: When opening the popup menu on a section, select that section so
	  the menu action is performed on the clicked section

	Clean ups:
	* Make white label areas wider, so that more text fits in (suggested by
	  @Second_Breakfast)
	* Rename "recent files" to "recent patches"
	* Replaced app icon by a version contributed by @Harrison (thanks for your nice icon,
	  Harrison!)


1.0:
	New features:
	* Do an automatic backup of your patch whenever it is modified. If the Forge
	  or your computer crashes, you can restore that backup (you will be asked).
	* Support the keys Home and End in the controller selection dialog.

	Bug fixes:
	* FIX: Fix crash when loading drumsequencer.ini from the video series. Reason
	  was a comment like "# BD = bass drum" in the global comment section (reported
	  and nailed down by @Brian (The Aefonic))
	* FIX: When double clicking on the background, the new circuit will now be placed
	  nearest to the click. That way you can easily decide where to insert a new
	  circuit. Before it was always on the top (reported by @odessa)
	* FIX: Fix missing icons for button/LED mismatch (bulb) and folded circuit
	* FIX: Fix cursor moving to unchartered territory when adding a jack while the
	  circuit is folded.
	* FIX: Fix titles of source code editor windows: make clear what's edited.
	* FIX: Fix window suddenly getting wider in certain situations.
	* FIX: Add new sections at the end when double clicking
	* FIX: Fix copy & paste of fractions like 1/120, which are allowed in the third
	       column
	* FIX: You now can enter fractions of the form 1/X into in input cell also
	       directly, without the dialog
	* FIX: Fixed memory leak that made the Forge more and more RAM.
	* FIX: Minor layout fixes in value selection dialog
	* FIX: Fix cursor hanging "in the air" when pasting a parameter line
	  into a folded circuit
	* FIX: Fix size of marker for used X1 register

	       space of another controller.

0.7:
    Bug fixes:
	* FIX: Mac: automatically detect dark/light mode switch of system preferences
	       and immediately switch colors in the Forge, as well (might also work
	       on Windows, but not tested yet).
	* FIX: Fix text in cell overlapping to next cell
	* FIX: Fix too large initial size of dialogs
	* FIX: Fix too large font size of internal cable statusbar information on
               Windows
	* FIX: Get rid of bogus "Meta" shortcut key on Windows

	Features:
	* Cell editor: add icon and description of parameter type (CV, gate, etc.)
	* Statusbar: add information (comment) or problem icon
	* Rack view: new option to show G8 or X7 just when they are used by the patch
	* Find related control: New menu action (and shortcut ?) for jumping around

	       with typical example (default values of input jacks)
	* FIX: Don't wrap text in control labels if it's too long
	* FIX: Fix misaligned problem marker if parameter has a comment
	* FIX: Fix parsing of "root = I1 / 120 + 18"
	* FIX: Don't show problem for duplicate usage of output when the
	       line is disabled
	* FIX: Avoid loosing the first comment line a circuit when editing
	       the circuit's source code with Cmd+U
	* FIX: Don't jump to end of text when editing in the mids of
	       a cable name (when creating or renaming cables)
	* FIX: Fix size of vertical separator bar and paddings
	* FIX: cable section list now makes use of available width
	* FIX: Fix various bugs when the cursor is in the 2nd or 3rd
	       cell of an input parameter and is then moved up or down
		   to an output parameter.
	* FIX: Avoid cursor moving into empty column in parameter
	       selector

	Features:
	* Support for magenta-12
	* Cell editor: Make description of parameter selectable
	* Patch view: double click on parameter name edits parameter comment
	  (information) instead of a change of the parameter (that can still
	  be done with Enter)
	* Menu: New action "New with same rack...". This is like "New..." but
	  keeps all controllers in place. The short cut of "New..." and the
	  toolbar icon now call this action.
	* Add hint when clicking two times a row on a button
	* Help menu: Add link to Discord community

	* FIX: Fix two undo messages (bogus "%s" in message)

	* FIX: Memory computation now also takes controllers into account (just
	       a slight difference but that might be important)

	Features:
	* Fast copy: command + mouse click on a cell copies that cell's content
	  to the cursor position (previously it was vice versa)
	* Edit cell: After editing the contents of a cell (via direct typing
	  or via the cell editor) the cursor moves one row down (if there
	  is one more in the current circuit)
	* Parameter chooser: Add information about the type of CV a parameter
	  expects or outputs.
	* Mac DMG: Create background image for DMG installer (not final yet)
