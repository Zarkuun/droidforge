This is the source code of the Droid Forge. The Droid Forge is the graphical
configuration tool for Droid the Universal CV processor

The Droid Forge is available under the terms of GPL v3.

If you want to build your own version of the Forge you need to install the Qt
framework. This version of the Forge requires Qt 6.3.1.  But probably a newer
version will work as well if you update the project settings.  After changing
the source code the easiest way to use your version of the Forge is to run it
from the Qt Creator.

Creating an installation package is more complicated.

For creating a Windows installer, build the Forge on Windows using the Qt
installation for Windows. It needs the Windows Visual C++ compiler installed,
which is available for free. Install Git for Windows. That comes with a Linux
like command line where the bash is running. Herein you can use the script
winrelease to create a Windows installation package.

Creating a Mac installer is considerable more hassle. First you need a (paid)
copy of DMG Canvas for creating the DMG. Then you need to sign in for Apple's
developer programm (100$/y) and get a software signing key. The script
macrelease then can create an installation DMG. If you just create that for your
own use, maybe disable all the signing and notarizing stuff in that script and
create an unsigned version.
